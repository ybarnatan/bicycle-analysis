The bike sharing system is present in Buenos Aires as well as in other many cities in the world, in which users share bycicles as mode of commuting. 

There are lots of advantages to this type of movility, such as improving user's health while reducing vehicular traffic and thus air pollution in the city.  Also, it releases the comprpomise of having to invest and storage a adult-sized bycicle that may eat a lot of space in people's apartments. 
Here I work with a public database of Buenos Aires city's government and show some EDA, both quantitative and cartographic.

Notes:
1.Even though variableÂ´s names are in spanish, the code es easy following and comments are in english.
2.Database is publicly accesible.
